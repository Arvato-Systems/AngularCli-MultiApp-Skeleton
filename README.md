# AngularCliMultiApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0 and is intended to demonstrate how you can create multiple apps within a single angularCli project. The apps can be started and built seperately by using the `--app` flag.

The apps are defined in the `.angular-cli.json` where different main.ts files are defined to bootstrap the root modules of the apps.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --app app1` or `ng serve --app app2` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build --app app1` or `ng build --app app2` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
